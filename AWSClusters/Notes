-Collection of worker Nodes and a Master Node
-Two of the best tools to automate clusters: KPOS and EKS
-KPOS
    -Is a older than EKS
    -KPOS is officaly part of the K8S infrastructure
    -Responsable for managing master node
-EKS
    -Is part of AWS itself
    -NOT responsable for managing master node and you don't see the master node at all

-KPOS VS EKS
    *KPOS
    Pros:
        -Long history and is widly used
        -Easy to use?
    Cons:
        -You have to manage the master node
        -By default yuo get a single master started(is configurable so more can be started up)
        -Feels more work than EKS?
    *EKS
    Pros:
        -Is really popular
        -Using eksctl is quite simple to use
        -No management of the Master node is requierd
    Cons:
        -Needs eksctl(3rd party tool) to make it usable
-       -The GUI(as of July 2020) is very poor
        -EKS integrates good with AWS Fargate
