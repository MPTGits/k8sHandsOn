Commands:
-'minikube service list' -> Gives us allocated resources and ports
-'kubectl describe svc <service>' -> Describes a service
-'kubectl get pods | --show-lables | -l <selector_to_filter_by>'

Tips:
-Pods are throw away, the are short lived and restart
-Service are a long running object, they have ip adress and stable fixed pods
-Pods can have key-value pairs called labels
-Service have Selectors that are key-value pairs and it matches them to the pod with the same lable
-Service v1Core
-Name of service is critical it is important to give good names
-No LoadBalancer locally so we can't use it as a type of the service(locally we can user CluserIP for internal traffic in the cluster or NodePort)
-We can do multiple deployments thanks to labels and just change the label to the release we want to use in the service
-It is common to define multiple version definitions in the same file
-Sometimes browsers cache content so we can do a 'hard' refresh when we apply a pod/service with CTRL+F5
